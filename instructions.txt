This code provides a complete environment to train and test a deep reinforcement learning agent that plays Connect4. It is suited for python 3.6 and requires the following modules : Tensorflow, Keras, graphviz, pydot ; all of which can be downloaded with pip or conda. 

To TRAIN the agent : 

- run main_train.py. Since initialise.py contains ‘None’ for each variable, you will train a brand new agent.

NB : Our best agent is in file train/run_archive/connect4/run0001/version0029.h5

To TEST the agent :

- Run test.py . With the current parameters, you will play against our best agent. When it’s your turn, just choose the column you want to put your yellow chip in, by entering a number between 0 and 6. 

- You can make the AI play against a random or minimax player by changing the yellow player.
